                        Design and Implementation for Primary Production applications"
                        <br>This project was awarder from a three-member committee (PROFESSORS of the University of Thessaly)
                        with 10/10 (Excellent).<br>
                        This is an app writen on React Native , so it can run on a variety of devices (IOS , WINDOWS ,ANDROID).

                        the user and for sure
                        the 'Forget Password ' is there too!. All these are designed by me and connected with the

                        of the AWS( Cognito , I AM ) for easy managment from the admin.

                    <p>The "Home" screen is there to display all the data that are collected from the arduino
                        System
                        (Project 1.2). There are some nice effects about the Humidity and Temperature changes and also
                        some
                        advises for the user about his plants.
                        Secondly ,you can see the "Weather" screen that the user can check the weather for all places on
                        earth .The
                        special thing about that is that is working with coordinates (latitude and longitude) so you can
                        see
                        the weather
                        on the exact point of earth you want (cooperation with OpenWeather & Google Geolocation API'S
                        ).On
                        the third photo you can see all the data that are taken from Arduino System (Project 1.2)
                        and on the last photo you can just read some infomation about some crops .

                        & notifications
                        to users . Also that was connected and with some scripts so the user could take some
                        automated notifications that was coming
                        from the Arduino System (Project 1.2) .For example in case of a fire , a Notification with a
                        strange sound
                        you come over to the user .
